how to install:
1. download the eigen library, use only the src file on /src/Eigen
2. download sift and siftsmall dataset on data/
3. run ivf.py, then you get:

sift_centroid_4096.fvecs
 - this means the centroids, 4096 means # centroids, shape (# centroid, vec_dim)
sift_cluster_id_4096.ivecs
 - this means the cluster ID that each item points to, shape (# item, 1)
sift_dist_to_centroid_4096.fvecs
 - this means the distance to the centroid of each item, shape (# item, 1)

4. run rabitq.py, then you get:

./sift/P_C4096_B128.fvecs
 - the projection matrix, shape (vec_dim, vec_dim)
./sift/RandCentroid_C4096_B128.fvecs
 - centroids after rotation, shape (# centroid, vec_dim)
./sift/x0_C4096_B128.fvecs
 - estimated inner product between the item and the quantized item
 - used for estimating the query score, shape (# centroid, 1)
 - the vector are stored of residual
./sift/RandNet_C4096_B128.Ivecs
 - the code of each item in uint64_t, shape (# item, vec_dim / 64)
 - the vector are stored with residual


5. run script/index.sh, then you get:

ivfrabitq4096_B128.index at data/sift/
 - the index file, mainly pack the following index
index_sift at bin/
 - the compile file

6. run script/search.sh, then you get:

search_sift at bin/
 - the compile file
log result of sift at results/
 - the search result
